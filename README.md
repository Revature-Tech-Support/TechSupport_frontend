## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to:
- Samuel Omole of freeCodeCamp
- Subhransu Maharana of dev.to
- And of course, a huge thank you to all of people in my batch:
I couldn't have done it without you.
(And even if I could, it wouldn't have been nearly as much fun!)

## Getting Started
1) git clone ```https://github.com/Revature-Tech-Support/TechSupport_frontend.git```
2) cd into folder of directory
3) install nodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
4) type in ```npm init``` in the command line, then follow prompts (alternatively, you can use ```npm init --y``` to automatically flag 'yes' to all the prompts)
5) ```npm i``` 
6) ```npm run``` (this should open the react app in your browser of choice)
* Note: On arch linux, nodeJS is a dependency of npm so if you are using this operating system, run ```sudo pacman -S npm``` instead
